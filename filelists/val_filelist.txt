DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0237.wav|2|I will now pass to grave but less atrocious crimes.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0238.wav|2|In eighteen fifty occurred the first of a series of gigantic frauds,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0239.wav|2|which followed each other at no long intervals, which had a strong family likeness, and originated all of them to make money easily,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0240.wav|2|without capital, and at railroad speed.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0241.wav|2|Walter Watts was an inventor, a creator, who struck an entirely new and original line of crime.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0242.wav|2|Employed as a clerk in the Globe Assurance,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0243.wav|2|he with unusual quickness of apprehension discovered and promptly turned to account an inexcusably lax system of management,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0244.wav|2|which offered peculiar chances of profit to an ingenious and unscrupulous man.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0245.wav|2|It was the custom in this office to make the banker's passbook the basis of the entries in the company's ledgers.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0246.wav|2|Thus, when a payment was made by the company, the amount disbursed was carried to account in the general books from its entry in the passbook,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0247.wav|2|and without reference to or comparison with the documents in which the payment was claimed.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0248.wav|2|This passbook, when not at the bank, was in the exclusive custody of Watts.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0249.wav|2|The cheques drawn by the directors also passed through his hands; to him too they came back to be verified and put by,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0250.wav|2|after they had been cashed by the bank.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0251.wav|2|In this way Watts had complete control over the whole of the monetary transactions of the company.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0252.wav|2|He could do what he liked with the passbook, and by its adoption, as described as the basis of all entries,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0253.wav|2|there was no independent check upon him if he chose to tamper with it.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0254.wav|2|This he did to an enormous extent,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0255.wav|2|continually altering, erasing, and adding figures to correspond with and cover the abstractions he made of various cheques as they were drawn.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0256.wav|2|It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0257.wav|2|was a mass of blots and erasures, should not have created suspicion of foul play either at the bank or at the company's board.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0258.wav|2|Implicit confidence appears to have been placed in Watts, who was the son of an old and trusted employee, and, moreover, a young man of plausible address.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0259.wav|2|Watts led two lives.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0260.wav|2|In the West End he was a man of fashion, with a town house, a house at Brighton, and a cellar full of good wine at both.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0261.wav|2|He rode a priceless hack in Rotten Row, or drove down to Richmond in a mail phaeton and pair.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0262.wav|2|He played high, and spent his nights at the club, or in joyous and dissolute company.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0263.wav|2|When other pleasures palled he took a theatre, and posed as a munificent patron of the dramatic art.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0264.wav|2|Under his auspices several "stars" appeared on the boards of the Marylebone theatre,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0265.wav|2|and later he became manager of the newly rebuilt Olympic at Wych Street.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0266.wav|2|No one cared too closely to inquire into the sources of wealth. Some said he was a fortunate speculator in stocks,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0267.wav|2|others that he had had extraordinary luck as a gold-digger. Had his West End and little-informed associates followed him into the city,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0268.wav|2|whither he was taken every morning in a smart brougham, they would have seen him alight from it in Cornhill,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0269.wav|2|and walk forward on foot to enter as a humble and unpretending employee the doors of the Globe Assurance office.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0271.wav|2|Nevertheless, in this position, through the culpable carelessness which left him unfettered, he managed between eighteen forty-four|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0272.wav|2|and eighteen fifty to embezzle and apply to his own purposes some seventy-one thousand pounds.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0273.wav|2|The detection of these frauds came while he was still prominently before the world as the lessee of the Olympic.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0274.wav|2|Rumors were abroad that serious defalcations had been discovered in one of the insurance offices,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0275.wav|2|but it was long before the public realized that the fraudulent clerk and the great theatrical manager were one and the same person.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0276.wav|2|Watts's crime was discovered by the secretary of the Globe Company, who came suddenly upon the extensive falsification of the passbook.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0277.wav|2|An inquiry was at once set on foot, and the frauds were traced to Watts.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0278.wav|2|The latter, when first taxed with his offense, protested his innocence boldly, and positively denied all knowledge of the affair;|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0279.wav|2|and he had so cleverly destroyed all traces that it was not easy to bring home the charge.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0280.wav|2|But it was proved that Watts had appropriated one cheque for fourteen hundred pounds,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0281.wav|2|which he had paid into his own bankers, and on this he was committed to Newgate for trial.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0282.wav|2|There were two counts in the indictment: one for stealing a cheque value fourteen hundred pounds, the second for stealing a bit of paper value one penny.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0283.wav|2|The jury found him guilty of the latter only, with a point of law reserved. This was fully argued before three judges,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0285.wav|2|and not for the slight offense as it appeared on the record.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0286.wav|2|The sentence of the court, one of ten years' transportation, struck the prisoner with dismay.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0287.wav|2|He had been led to suppose that twelve months' imprisonment was the utmost the law could inflict, and he broke down utterly under the unexpected blow.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0288.wav|2|That same evening he committed suicide in Newgate.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0289.wav|2|The details of the suicide were given at the inquest. Watts had been in ill-health from the time of his first arrest.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0290.wav|2|In Giltspur Street Compter, where he was first lodged|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0291.wav|2|he showed symptoms of delirium tremens, and admitted that he had been addicted to the excessive use of stimulants.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0292.wav|2|His health improved, but was still indifferent when he was brought up for sentence, and he was an occupant of the Newgate infirmary.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0293.wav|2|He returned from court in a state of gloomy dejection,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0294.wav|2|and in the middle of the night one of the fellow-prisoners who slept in the same ward noticed that he was not in his bed.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0295.wav|2|This man got up to look for him, and found him hanging from the bars of a neighboring room.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0296.wav|2|He had made use of a piece of rope cut out from the sacking of his bedstead, and had tied his feet together with a silk pocket-handkerchief.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0297.wav|2|The prison officers were called, but Watts was quite cold and stiff when he was cut down.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0298.wav|2|Strange to say, a second suicide occurred in Newgate the same night,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0299.wav|2|that of a prize-fighter named Donovan, tried the same day, and convicted of manslaughter.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0300.wav|2|Sentence of death had been recorded against Donovan, who, like Watts, had seemingly been overcome with sudden despair.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0301.wav|2|In eighteen fifty-three a second case of gigantic fraud alarmed and scandalized the financial world.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0302.wav|2|It outshone the defalcations of Watts.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0303.wav|2|Nothing to equal the excitement caused by the forgeries of Robert Ferdinand Pries had been known before in the city of London.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0304.wav|2|He was a corn merchant who operated largely in grain.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0305.wav|2|So enormous were his transactions, that they often affected the markets, and caused great fluctuations in prices.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0306.wav|2|These had been attributed to political action; some thought that the large purchases in foreign grains, effected at losing prices,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0307.wav|2|were intended by the protectionists to depress the wheat market, and secure the support of the farmers at the forthcoming election;|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0308.wav|2|others, that Napoleon the third, but recently proclaimed Emperor of the French, wished to gain the popularity necessary to secure the people.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0309.wav|2|Few realized that these mysterious operations were the "convulsive attempt" of a ruined and dishonest speculator to sustain his credit.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0310.wav|2|Pries, although enjoying a high reputation in the city, had long been in a bad way.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0311.wav|2|His extensive business had been carried on by fraud.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0312.wav|2|His method was to obtain advances twice over on the same bills of lading or corn warrants. The duplicates were forged.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0313.wav|2|In this way he obtained vast sums from several firms, and one to which he was indebted upwards of fifty thousand pounds subsequently stopped payment.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0314.wav|2|Pries at length was discovered|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0315.wav|2|through a dishonored cheque for three thousand pounds, paid over as an installment of eighteen thousand pounds owing for an advance on warrants.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0316.wav|2|Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0317.wav|2|Pries was lodged in Newgate, tried at the Old Bailey, and transported for life.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0318.wav|2|Another set of frauds, which resembled those of Pries in principle, although not in practice, were soon afterwards discovered.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0320.wav|2|proposed to gain the capital he needed for business purposes by raising money on dock warrants for imported goods which had no real existence.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0321.wav|2|When such goods arrived they were frequently left at a wharf, paying rent until it suited the importer to remove them.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0322.wav|2|The dock warrant was issued by the wharfinger as certificate that he held the goods.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0323.wav|2|The warrant thus represented money, and was often used as such, being endorsed and passed from hand to hand as other negotiable bills.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0324.wav|2|Cole's plan was to have a wharf of his own, nominally occupied by a creature trading as Maltby and Co.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0325.wav|2|Goods would be landed at this wharf;|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0326.wav|2|Maltby and Co. would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer, and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0327.wav|2|The owners of the latter would then issue a second set of warrants on these goods, in total ignorance of the fact that they were already pledged.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0328.wav|2|Cole quickly raised money on both sets of warrants. He carried on this game for some time with great success,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0329.wav|2|and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0330.wav|2|He had several narrow escapes.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0331.wav|2|Once a warrant-holder sent down a clerk to view certain goods, and the clerk found that these goods had already a "stop" upon them, or were pledged.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0332.wav|2|Cole escaped by throwing the blame on a careless partner, and at once removed the "stop."|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0333.wav|2|Again, some of the duplicate and fictitious warrants were held by a firm which suspended payment, and there was no knowing into whose hands they might fall.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0334.wav|2|Cole found out where they were, and redeemed them at a heavy outlay, thus obtaining business relations with the firm that held them,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0335.wav|2|which were soon developed, much to that firm's subsequent anger and regret.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0336.wav|2|Last of all, the well-known bankers Overend and Gurney, whose own affairs created much excitement some years later,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0337.wav|2|wishing to verify the value of warrants they held, and sending to Maltby and Co.'s wharf, found out half the truth.|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0338.wav|2|These bankers, wishing for more specific information,|en
DUMMY/LJ/LJ014-0339.wav|2|asked Davidson and Gordon, a firm with which Cole was closely allied, whether the warrants meant goods or nothing.|en
